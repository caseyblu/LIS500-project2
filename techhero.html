          <h2>Our Tech Hero â€” A Champion in Advancing AI Ethics</h2>

          <p>
            Timnit Gebru is an Eritrean American computer scientist, activist, and leading voice in the field of AI ethics. She has shaped the tech industry by exposing algorithmic bias and pushing for more diversity and accountability in AI. Her research showed how facial recognition tools often fail on women and people of color, making clear the real-world harms of biased systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gebru also reminds us that ethics in AI is not just about fixing code. It is about changing the structures behind it. She has called for transparency in how data is collected, more representation of marginalized voices, and accountability for the ways AI is used. By founding the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR), she created a space to study AI free from corporate influence and pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through her work and advocacy, Timnit Gebru challenges the tech world to think about not only what AI can do but what it should do.
