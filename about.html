    <!-- Aymen's about language here -->
    <h2>Aymen Hamdan</h2>
    <p> 
      Aymen Hamdan is a current third year undergraduate student majoring in Information Science and Biology. He is interested in learning more about 
      societal usage of technology, as well as how technological development is shaping our world. He is also looking to gain more skills in program development.
      His tech hero is Thomas Edison, as he invented multiple technologies that are the base for what we have today.

    <h2>Alyssa Hannam</h2>
    <p>
      Alyssa Hannam is a second-year graduate student pursuing her MS in Information and Data Science with a UX/UI Design emphasis.
      She is currently working as a UX Design intern, continuing from her summer internship into the school year.
      She took this course to better understand how tech and the humanities can cross over into each other. 
      With people being the most important part of any industry, it’s vital to understand how we all work together and how implicit bias
      can shape those interactions. Her favorite tech thing is filtering tools that make data tables more accessible for users, 
      since they help refine and reorganize information in ways that reduce barriers and create more usable, inclusive experiences.

    <!-- Casey's about language here -->
    <h2>Casey Foubert</h2>
    <p>
     Casey is in his second year at the University of Wisconsin’s Master of Library and Information Studies program.
      He is transitioning from a full-time career in music to a new path in archives and libraries, while continuing to stay connected to his freelance music work. His favorite area of technology is music software platforms, such as <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/what-is-live/">Ableton Live</a>, which enable flexible music creation through techniques like sampling, synthesis, sequencing, looping, digital signal processing, and live recording. Casey admires people who strive to make technology accessible, open, fair, stable, and easy to use.
